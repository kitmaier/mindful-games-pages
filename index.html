		<p>Meditation games to improve attention, concentration, mindfulness, and awareness.</p>
		<h2>What is meditation?</h2>
		<p>Try to sit quietly, and just concentrate on one thing. It doesn't matter what that one thing is. You could repeat some words in your head, or imagine you are in a particular location, or just focus on the feeling of your breath in your chest. This is not difficult at first, but in a few minutes you will find your mind wandering off to something else. This is like trying to hold your arm out straight with a pillow on your hand. At first it is easy, but the longer you try to do it, the more tired your arm gets, even with that small weight to support.</p>
		<p>If you keep practicing for a few more minutes, you will find that your ability to concentrate comes back for a while, and then goes away for awhile. Then it comes back, then it goes away. Over and over you will forget what you were trying to do, then remember, then forget again. Like the waves on a beach sweeping in and out every few minutes, your power of concentration surges and recedes.</p>
		<p>Meditation means watching your mind in this way, and learning its patterns. Learning to recognize what draws and keeps your attention, what makes you turn away, and how your natural internal rhythm interacts with your circumstances. Learning to recognize when distractions are pulling you away from what matters, whether that is work, or school, or a conversation, or an experience. Meditation means learning to control your attention, so that you can choose to focus on what you think is important, even if your mind is trying to pull you away to something else.</p>
		<p>With practice, this gets easier, but it takes a great deal of practice. Meditation is difficult, time-consuming, and frequently misunderstood. Most people who have tried meditation have not seen the results that they hoped for, and have given up. Even people who have been meditating for a long time may have difficulty explaining what benefit, if any, they have gotten from it.</p>
		<p>I believe that we have an opportunity, with the technology that exists today, to solve these problems forever. In the old days, meditation would be practiced face-to-face with a master, who could give personalized feedback in real time. With the tools we have today, that could be done automatically. The games hosted on this website are designed to help someone who is just starting out with meditation by giving them real-time, interactive feedback on the quality of their concentration, as well as personalized guidance on how to continue to improve.</p>
